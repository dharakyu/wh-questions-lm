25	256	49881:4	what was i thinking 	0.1142105263157894	0.07	0.3699999999999999	0.4457894736842104	what	0	actually, they picked up some from minnesota.i think  it was, uh, minnesota's mumblex, [SEP] oh, that's right,that's right.they,it went the other way. [SEP] yeah. [SEP]  
26	329	59442:6	so why  have any restrictions at all 	0.3374999999999999	0.2445	0.418	5.5511151231258e-18	why	0	but if you're not a, if you're not a basically good citizen,you just told me that you're going  to get one of those guns anyway.

27	532	5953:28	why didn't you buy, why didn't you try something more mainline 	0.1284210526315789	0.1889473684210526	0.6663157894736841	0.0163157894736842	why	0	 [SEP] yeah. [SEP] and a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they provide  you know,people generally go with that because they figure that the, you know, you probably won't get fired  for  getting i b m material.whereas if you try something different, they'll they'll say yeah, [SEP] and it failsand you're dead. [SEP]  
28	806	59481:4	how does the argument work if, uh, if the bad guys are going  to have guns anyway 	0.1319047619047618	0.3704761904761904	0.359047619047619	0.1385714285714285	how	0	 [SEP] well, the han-, in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly  as the weapon, as a, as a pistol.

[SEP]  [SEP] well, i have a bicycleand that scares me too  to tell you the truth because i've been run  off the road and all sorts of things.well, i'm still, i'm still puzzled though,what  is the argument, 
29	203	122764:4	what did we do  without it back then?	0.1159090909090909	0.1286363636363636	0.5149999999999999	0.24	what	0	uh-huh,yeah,i've h-, seen him before. [SEP]  [SEP]  [SEP]  wh-, i-, what would we do  without it?. [SEP] yeah. yo-, we were talking about that just the other day. 
30	583	76373:38	can you, how can you, how can you expect  to,	0.1380952380952381	0.2661904761904762	0.1895238095238095	0.4061904761904762	how	1	and it's,and you know, as a teacher you're alert, you're alert for the kid who  very drowsy.you're alert to the kid who  suddenly has a, um, behavioral change,and you refer them to the nurse. [SEP] right. [SEP] and, so, i mean, you have  to find out whether there's a legitimate reason, or whether this is a warning signal. [SEP] yeah, 
31	474	149947:9	mumblex, how do you feel about crime in the city 	0.1557894736842105	0.1152631578947368	0.4078947368421052	0.3205263157894736	how	0	 i i don't, i don't think  george bush will make the american people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. [SEP] no,no,not at all. [SEP] i just don't think  it was a well thought out incentive. [SEP] no. [SEP]  
32	561	76197:228	well, then, then again when you have, uh, a society where a certain percentage of the parents are, uh, doing drugs in the home uh, either unemployed and don't care about a, uh, just a have their own problems   how, how do you expect the school to, um, or how do you expect the,	0.1968421052631578	0.3268421052631579	0.203157894736842	0.2731578947368421	how	0	but, um, it, it is a problem,and i'm not sure just, uh, how, how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it  [SEP] yeah. [SEP] whether maybe through a commitment of the p t a, uh, and the parents being informed  better, that in fact that the problems that  are nationwide are problems, um, of society, and that, that the school can only do so much on it. [SEP] yeah. [SEP]  [SEP]  
33	139	174259:54	if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances who   to say.	0.1036363636363636	0.3109090909090909	0.3509090909090909	0.2345454545454545	who	0	about the only good thing  i would say  about that is  it w-, that it would, uh, hurry the process up a bit [SEP] yeah. [SEP] but i mean even now we've got, i know  we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted  and things like that  that's what the trial by jury. [SEP] i know mumblex. [SEP] i mean, jeez 
34	76	169955:188	but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or th-, grandparents, whatever it is  uh, who  were ready, who, who you thought   might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think  you would look for 	0.3804761904761904	0.24	0.2752380952380952	0.1042857142857142	what	1	so that probably wouldn't be too good either.

36	312	20333:4	where do you, do you come from  originally	0.023	0.027	0.933	0.017	where	0	that's true.and i did pay state tax in california,but my goodness, that, that, the, what did you call it  the sales tax, is just getting outrageous  to pay. [SEP] yeah.that's true. [SEP] you don't sound like you're from dallas. 
37	704	175577:75	who  knows what  going  to happen in another thirty years	0.0957142857142857	0.0961904761904761	0.0595238095238095	0.7485714285714286	who	0	 [SEP]  and, uh, and, you know, i can get up, [SEP] i know. it, it seems  to be, be kind of, kind of scary, you know. because you think of,uh, see my son's eighteen right nowand he, he's, uh, he wants  to go into engineering.and the, the, the branches of engineering that he wants  to go into  is now kind of openand he's interested in, basically, three different areas.but, uh, it  difficult for me to try  to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that. he needs  to do his own course of investigation and, and see what he can do  because .
38	686	14538:4	what are they going up to 	0.05	0.1605555555555555	0.5900000000000001	0.1994444444444444	what	0	and, you know, they'll, they'll wind up  being good again.they've got some, lot of really good young players that  are going  to, that  are going  to, uh, do pretty good, i think   they're raising prices on their tickets.so they're banking on  doing good next season.i think  tickets are, [SEP] again. [SEP] yeah. [SEP]  
39	14	143033:4	where have you been 	0.5955555555555555	0.1844444444444444	0.1594444444444444	0.0605555555555556	where	0	 [SEP] uh-huh. [SEP] but, um, i guess  my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland. [SEP] uh-huh.yeahwell, i've been over there too. [SEP] uh-huh. 
40	460	66452:4	what  was the results there.	0.1310526315789473	0.0352631578947368	0.78	0.0536842105263157	what	0	 [SEP] uh-huh. [SEP] and of course, you know, they tried  to make the cop look ou-, like he was, uh, a, uh, no good rotten drunk. [SEP] yeah. [SEP] i mean it was amazing. [SEP] so what  was the verdict, 
41	608	92665:4	what did she do with 	0.0505263157894736	0.1073684210526315	0.3863157894736842	0.4552631578947368	what	0	because her effort would have really, um, really, uh, been a good example for all of us. and yet, you know, and we were just sort of talking about it at the time.and here we are  you know,now we're doing it on a, city wide basis in, in communities. [SEP] doing it. [SEP] so it  wonderful that we've come that far, i think   um. [SEP]  
42	413	174752:4	what do you do  georgeanne?	0.0309523809523809	0.2061904761904762	0.5061904761904762	0.2566666666666667	what	0	but, i don't know,maybe mumblex, [SEP]  i, yeah i tend  to think  the repeal system for the death penalty is a little, little too lenient. [SEP] yeah. [SEP] uh,  kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty. [SEP] uh-huh. 
43	101	53731:6	but why  not hit the points  the kid's really interested in  	0.2263157894736841	0.1710526315789473	0.5499999999999999	0.0526315789473684	why	0	other kids are going  to be really into math,some are really going  to be heavy into reading.
